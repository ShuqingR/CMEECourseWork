  % discriptive stats
  Data of Florida annual mean temperaturs were collected for a centry (100 years) 
  between 1901 and 2000. The annual mean temperatures ranges from 23.75 to 
  26.35 degree Celsius, with a mean of 25.31 (SD = 0.50).

  % correlation coefficient & apparent asymptotic p-value
  The Pearson correlation coefficient of annual mean temperatures between 
  successive year pairs was 0.53, showing a positive correlation.
  As figure \ref{fig:plot} shows, the annual mean temperature increases 
  as year progresses. The correlation was statistically significant 
  with an approximate p-value < 0.01, calculated from permutation analysis (simulation time = 10000).
